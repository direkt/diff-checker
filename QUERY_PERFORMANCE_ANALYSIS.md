# Dremio Query Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines a Dremio query profile that took **511.35 seconds** to execute, identifying the primary performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Key Findings

### ðŸ”¥ Primary Bottleneck: TableFunction Operator (Op 6)
- **Total Time**: 487.76s (95.4% of total query time)
- **Fragment**: 0-0, Operator 6
- **Type**: TableFunction (Data File Scan)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Setup: 22.22s (4.6%)
  - Process: 330.23s (67.7%) 
  - Wait: 135.31s (27.7%)

### ðŸ“Š Data Volume Analysis
- **Records Processed**: 1.45 billion records
- **Data Size**: 127.42GB
- **Throughput**: 4.4M records/second
- **I/O**: 9.74GB actual bytes read (compression ratio ~13:1)

### ðŸŽ¯ Filter Efficiency Issue
- **Operator 5 (Filter)** processed 1.45B records but only output 6 records
- **Selectivity**: 0.000% (extremely low)
- **Implication**: The filter predicates are applied after reading massive amounts of data

## Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. I/O Bottleneck (Primary Issue)
- **Wait Time**: 135.31s (27.7% of total execution)
- **Root Cause**: Reading large volumes of data from storage
- **Impact**: High latency in data retrieval operations

### 2. Poor Predicate Pushdown
- **Issue**: Filter is applied after table scan instead of being pushed down
- **Evidence**: 1.45B records read but only 6 records needed
- **Impact**: Unnecessary I/O and processing overhead

### 3. Memory Usage
- **Peak Memory**: 19.77MB for main TableFunction
- **Assessment**: Memory usage is reasonable, not a bottleneck

## Optimization Recommendations

### ðŸš€ High Impact Optimizations

1. **Improve Predicate Pushdown**
   - Ensure filters on `cob_date`, `ObligorId`, `MeasureCode`, and `AggType` are pushed to storage layer
   - Consider partitioning strategy aligned with common filter predicates
   - Verify Iceberg table metadata supports efficient pruning

2. **Partitioning Strategy**
   - Partition by `cob_date` (appears to be a common filter)
   - Consider sub-partitioning by `ObligorId` or `MeasureCode`
   - This could eliminate scanning irrelevant data files

3. **Columnar Storage Optimization**
   - Ensure frequently filtered columns are stored efficiently
   - Consider column ordering for better compression and filtering

### ðŸ”§ Medium Impact Optimizations

4. **Query Rewrite**
   - Review if the `NOT LIKE '%ALD%'` condition can be optimized
   - Consider using equality predicates instead of LIKE when possible

5. **Statistics and Cost-Based Optimization**
   - Ensure table statistics are up-to-date
   - Verify Dremio's cost-based optimizer has accurate cardinality estimates

6. **Reflection/Materialized Views**
   - Consider creating aggregated reflections for common query patterns
   - Pre-aggregate data by common grouping dimensions

### âš¡ Infrastructure Optimizations

7. **Storage Performance**
   - Evaluate storage system performance (S3, HDFS, etc.)
   - Consider faster storage tiers for frequently accessed data

8. **Cluster Resources**
   - Current query used only 1 executor node
   - Consider parallelization opportunities for large scans

## Query Pattern Analysis

### Current Query Characteristics
- **Type**: Analytical aggregation query
- **Pattern**: Large scan with heavy filtering and grouping
- **Data Access**: Point lookup pattern (specific date, obligor, measure)
- **Selectivity**: Extremely low (0.000%)

### Recommended Query Pattern
```sql
-- Optimized approach: Ensure predicates are pushed down
SELECT 
    MeasureCode,
    infotype,
    Tenor,
    LegalEntity,
    SUM(infovalue) AS info_value
FROM banshee_std_base
WHERE cob_date = '2024-04-18'
  AND ObligorId = '1221133'
  AND MeasureCode = 'EPE_Coll_pv_profile'
  AND AggType = 'Obligor'
  AND (ReportAspect NOT LIKE '%ALD%' OR ReportAspect IS NULL)
GROUP BY MeasureCode, infotype, Tenor, LegalEntity
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate - High ROI)
1. Verify and fix predicate pushdown
2. Update table statistics
3. Review partitioning strategy

### Phase 2 (Short-term)
1. Implement optimal partitioning
2. Create targeted reflections
3. Query pattern optimization

### Phase 3 (Long-term)
1. Infrastructure improvements
2. Advanced indexing strategies
3. Workload management optimization

## Expected Performance Improvement

With proper predicate pushdown and partitioning:
- **Estimated improvement**: 50-90% reduction in execution time
- **Target time**: 30-60 seconds (from 511 seconds)
- **Key factor**: Reducing data scanned from 127GB to <1GB

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Track key metrics**:
   - Data scanned vs. data returned ratio
   - Predicate pushdown effectiveness
   - I/O wait times

2. **Set up alerts** for:
   - Queries scanning >10GB for small result sets
   - Execution times >60 seconds for this query pattern
   - High I/O wait percentages (>20%)
