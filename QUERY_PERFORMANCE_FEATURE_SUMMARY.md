# Query Performance Analysis Feature - Enhanced Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Query Performance Analysis feature for the Dremio Query Diff Checker application that matches and exceeds the capabilities of the Python analysis scripts. This feature extracts and displays detailed performance metrics from Dremio query profiles, providing insights into bottlenecks and optimization opportunities with the same level of detail as the standalone Python tools.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure (`src/utils/jqUtils.ts`)

#### Comprehensive PerformanceMetrics Interface:
- **Query Information**: Query ID, user, Dremio version
- **Execution Summary**: Total, planning, and execution times
- **Operator Statistics**: Total operators, max/avg/total operator times
- **Top Operators**: Detailed operator metrics with I/O, memory, and throughput data
- **Query Phases**: Phase-by-phase execution breakdown
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Comprehensive bottleneck detection with severity levels
- **Data Volume Statistics**: Records processed, data sizes, throughput, compression ratios
- **Longest Running Items**: Identification of performance hotspots

#### Enhanced Operator Metrics:
```typescript
{
  operatorId: number;
  operatorType: string;
  operatorName: string;
  setupMs: number;
  processMs: number;
  waitMs: number;
  totalMs: number;
  fragmentId: string;
  inputRecords: number;
  outputRecords: number;
  inputBytes: number;
  outputBytes: number;
  peakMemoryMB: number;
  selectivity?: number;
